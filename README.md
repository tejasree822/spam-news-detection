# Spam News Detection

This project uses machine learning to detect spam news articles. It classifies news as either **spam** or **not spam** based on the content.

## Project Overview
The Jupyter Notebook `Spam_News_Detection` contains the following steps:
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature extraction
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Predictions on new data

## Files
- `Spam_News_Detection` : Main Jupyter Notebook with all code.  
- `requirements.txt` : List of Python dependencies required to run the notebook.

Note: The original datasets are large and not included in this repository.  
The notebook demonstrates the workflow using small sample data for illustration.
